        "Compared to other energy sources, the installation and running costs of wind power facilities are very low. However, building a wind farm does produce a certain amount of carbon emissions as well as other greenhouse gases. Research has shown that an average wind turbine balances out its carbon footprint within the first 5-7 months and generates zero-emission electricity for the rest of its 30 year lifespan. With technological improvements and the electrification of transport, CO2 emissions are expected to be reduced even further.",
